# Todo Manager

Welcome to Todo Manager, a task management application made in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was developed to help users manage their daily tasks effectively while exploring advanced JavaScript features, such as managing multiple user accounts, scheduling todos, and providing popup notifications for reminders.

### Features:

* **User Accounts:** Each user can create an account, allowing them to manage their todos separately.
* **Add, Edit, and Delete Todos:** Users can easily add new tasks, edit existing ones, or delete them as needed.
* **Scheduled Todos:** Set due dates and times for your tasks, and the app will automatically remind you when the deadline approaches.
* **Popup Notifications:** Receive real-time notifications for your scheduled todos, ensuring you never miss a deadline.
* **Persistent Storage:** All tasks and user data are saved in the browser's local storage, so your todos remain even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

### Project Purpose:

The development of Todo Manager allowed me to explore advanced JavaScript techniques, such as handling multiple user sessions, scheduling tasks, and triggering notifications. This project also provided an opportunity to enhance my understanding of web development fundamentals and local storage for persistent data management.
